							It was in late 2009 I was approached by my project lead and asked if I was willing to learn a new technology. 
							Having started my career just in 2007, was eager to learn new things. Well relatively fresh out of the college, 
							who could resist their zeal to learn something new... Immediately I was onboard with the new skills, 
							and for my surprise and may say sheer luck I was asked if I'm interested in an onsite oppurutnity and that 
							too Swiss, you couldn't believe my expression then. 
							<span class="italic"> An opportunity so early in your career that was literally GOLD and travelling to Swiss I can't ask more than that and not to forget the &euro;s :)</span>..
						</p>			
						
						<p> 
							A lot of things happened and it was like anything in tech projects, it took a while to hear further updates. 
							I was kind of 
							<span class="italic"> "Ok, so that was just an attempt to let me stay & continue supporting the Project with the newly acquired skills (well people used to talk not so good about the technology and the lack of oppurtutnies in it)". </span>
							Some time in early second half of 2010 I was asked to get ready with documentation you know passport, etc., so finally it's happening..
							I'm all set to start my maiden international travel on December 5th, 2010.

						<p> 
							From Chennai via Doha, Qatar <span class="italic"> I landed at Zurich airport on Dec 5th, 2010 at ~1.30pm </span>. Oh boy, I MADE it :) 
							It was a heavy winter time and lot snow around, and first moments of feeling the snow were thrilling. 
							I boarded my train from Zurich airport to Neucha&#771;tel - the DESTINATION... 
							I have had the wonderful oppurutnity to work and stay there for couple of years. That was one of the best phases of my life and 
							definitely a life time experience.
